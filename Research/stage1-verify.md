**Verification Process: Stage 1 Certification**

**Objective:** To formally verify that all outputs from Stage 1 (Specification & Foundation Refinement) are complete, accurate, internally consistent, aligned with the Project Plan, and sufficiently detailed to effectively guide Stage 2 (Core Component Implementation).

**Timing:** Execute this process *after* completing TASKS 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4, and *before* initiating any work under Stage 2 (TASK 2.1 onwards).

**Executor:** Solo Developer.

**Required Inputs:**

1. **Project Plan:** "IMS QTI 2.1 Assessment Package Generator" (Version 2.0 or latest approved).
2. **Stage 1 Artifact: Validated Requirements Summary:** The developer-reviewed and finalized list/document summarizing technical requirements extracted via TASK 1.1.
3. **Stage 1 Artifact: Finalized Pydantic Model Definitions:** The definitive specification or Python stub code for core input data models produced in TASK 1.2.
4. **Stage 1 Artifact: Jinja2 Template Structure Plan:** The documented directory layout, naming conventions, and list of key templates/macros/includes finalized in TASK 1.3.
5. **Stage 1 Artifact: Validation Logic Specification:** The detailed requirements document for the `lxml` validation function finalized in TASK 1.4.

**Verification Method:** Use the following checklist. Review each item critically against the specified inputs. Mark each item as Pass (✅) or Fail (❌). Add comments for any Failures.

| :------ | :----------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-----------: | :---------------------------- |
| **V1.1** | **Requirements Summary** | **Accuracy & Completeness:** Does the *Validated Requirements Summary* accurately reflect key technical constraints from the Project Plan (sample check Sections 4-10)? | Random sampling confirms key constraints (libs, standards, versions, core strategies) are present and match the Plan. No obvious major omissions are found.                                |       ☐       |                               |
| **V1.2** | **Requirements Summary** | **Coverage:** Does the summary include sections covering Pydantic, Jinja2, Validation (lxml), Packaging (zipfile), MathML, Assets, and BB Ultra Compatibility?    | All specified topic areas have corresponding summaries derived from the plan.                                                                                                      |       ☐       |                               |
| **V1.3** | **Requirements Summary** | **Finalization:** Have all developer comments/corrections from the TASK 1.1 HITL review been incorporated into the final summary artifact?                           | The artifact represents the final, reviewed state, not the raw agent output.                                                                                                   |       ☐       |                               |
| **V1.4** | **Pydantic Models**      | **Scope Coverage:** Do the *Finalized Pydantic Model Definitions* cover the structures needed for the initial planned scope/MVP (e.g., base items, chosen interactions)? | Models required for the immediate next steps in Stage 2 (e.g., `ChoiceInteractionData`, `AssetReference`, `LomMetadata` subset) are defined.                                     |       ☐       |                               |
| **V1.5** | **Pydantic Models**      | **Plan Alignment:** Do model fields, types, defaults, and specified validation rules directly map back to requirements in the Validated Summary and Plan Sec 5?       | Clear traceability exists between model definitions and the specified requirements. No contradictions found.                                                                       |       ☐       |                               |
| **V1.6** | **Pydantic Models**      | **Clarity & Implementability:** Are the model definitions sufficiently clear (field names, types, basic validation intent) to guide code generation in Stage 2?    | Definitions are unambiguous enough that a developer (or agent with the spec) could implement them without needing significant further clarification.                                  |       ☐       |                               |
| **V1.7** | **Jinja2 Structure**     | **Documentation:** Is the *Jinja2 Template Structure Plan* documented clearly (directory layout, naming)?                                                     | The plan exists and is understandable (e.g., as a text file, diagram, or README section).                                                                                       |       ☐       |                               |
| **V1.8** | **Jinja2 Structure**     | **Plan Alignment:** Does the structure support modularity (base, interactions, includes/macros) as required by the Validated Summary and Plan Sec 6?             | The proposed structure explicitly addresses the modularity requirement.                                                                                                          |       ☐       |                               |
| **V1.9** | **Jinja2 Structure**     | **Completeness:** Does the plan identify the key template files and reusable components (macros/includes like `render_mathml`, `_lom_metadata`) needed initially? | Essential components mentioned in the plan are listed in the structure definition.                                                                                               |       ☐       |                               |
| **V1.10**| **Validation Logic**     | **Clarity & Detail:** Is the *Validation Logic Specification* unambiguous regarding function signature, `lxml` usage, caching, and error handling?                 | All key aspects (inputs, output/return, caching mechanism via dict, `lxml`, custom exception, error log requirement, specific error catches) are explicitly defined.             |       ☐       |                               |
| **V1.11**| **Validation Logic**     | **Plan Alignment:** Does the spec directly reflect the requirements for validation detailed in the Validated Summary and Plan Sec 7?                            | The specification directly implements the decisions made regarding `lxml` validation in the plan.                                                                                |       ☐       |                               |
| **V1.12**| **Validation Logic**     | **Implementability:** Is the specification detailed enough to allow direct implementation of the `validate_xml` function in Stage 2?                              | A developer (or agent) could write the function based *only* on this specification without significant ambiguity.                                                                  |       ☐       |                               |
| **V1.13**| **Overall**              | **Consistency:** Are there any obvious contradictions between the different Stage 1 artifacts (e.g., Pydantic model field name differs from usage planned in Jinja2)? | Review confirms consistency in naming and structure across the different specification documents.                                                                                 |       ☐       |                               |
| **V1.14**| **Overall**              | **Storage:** Are all finalized Stage 1 artifacts (Summaries, Definitions, Plans, Specs) stored accessibly in the project repository/documentation area?          | All output artifacts are saved, committed to version control, and easily findable.                                                                                               |       ☐       |                               |

**Remediation Process:**

* If any checklist item is marked Fail (❌):
  * **STOP:** Do not proceed to Stage 2.
  * **Analyze:** Review the comments and understand the reason for failure.
  * **Correct:** Go back to the relevant task(s) in Stage 1 (e.g., TASK 1.2 if Pydantic models are incomplete, TASK 1.4 if validation spec is unclear). Perform the necessary corrections, refinements, or additions to the corresponding artifact(s). This may involve further analysis or even re-engaging with an AI assistant for clarification if appropriate, followed by developer HITL review.
  * **Re-Verify:** Once corrections are made, re-execute this entire Verification Checklist from the beginning. Repeat until all items pass.

**Certification:**

* Once all checklist items are marked Pass (✅):
  * **Sign-off:** Formally record the successful completion of the Stage 1 Verification. This could be:
    * A comment in the main Git commit that merges Stage 1 work (if applicable).
    * Updating a status field in a project tracking tool.
    * Adding a dated entry to the project's main README or a dedicated log file. Example: `Stage 1 Verification completed and passed by [Your Name] on [Date]. Proceeding to Stage 2.`
  * **Proceed:** You are now certified to begin Stage 2: Core Component Implementation.
