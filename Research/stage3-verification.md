Okay, Solo Developer. Here is the formal verification process to certify the completion of Stage 3, ensure consistency with Stages 1 and 2, and confirm readiness for Stage 4. This is a critical check focusing on successful integration, testing outcomes, and the crucial Blackboard Ultra validation results.

---

**Verification Process: Stage 3 Certification**

**Objective:** To formally verify that the integrated system functions as intended (for the completed scope), that comprehensive testing (unit, integration, manual) has been performed and documented, and that the system's performance against the primary acceptance criteria (Blackboard Ultra compatibility) is understood and recorded. This process ensures a validated baseline exists before entering the iterative refinement and bug-fixing cycle of Stage 4.

**Timing:** Execute this process *after* completing TASKS 3.1 (Integration), 3.2 (Unit Tests), 3.3 (Integration Tests), and 3.4 (Manual Acceptance Testing for the current scope) and *before* initiating Stage 4 (TASK 4.1 onwards).

**Executor:** Solo Developer.

**Required Inputs:**

1. **Stage 1 Artifacts:** (As needed for cross-referencing requirements)
    * Project Plan.
    * Validated Requirements Summary.
    * Finalized Pydantic Model Definitions.
    * Jinja2 Template Structure Plan.
    * Validation Logic Specification.
2. **Stage 2 Artifacts:** (The verified codebase components)
    * Implemented code for Models, Endpoints, Templates, Validation, Packaging.
3. **Stage 3 Outputs:**
    * **Integrated Codebase:** The current state of the code in Git after completing TASK 3.1.
    * **Unit Test Suite & Results:** Code in `tests/unit/`, `pytest` execution report (showing passing status), and ideally a code coverage report (`pytest --cov`). (from TASK 3.2)
    * **Integration Test Suite & Results:** Code in `tests/integration/`, `pytest` execution report (showing passing status). (from TASK 3.3)
    * **Manual Acceptance Testing (MAT) Results Log:** The detailed document/spreadsheet recording BB Ultra import/functionality tests, including successes, failures, screenshots, and analysis. (from TASK 3.4)
    * **Sample Data Suite:** The input data used for integration and manual testing.
    * Git commit history for Stage 3 work.

**Verification Method:** Use the following checklist. Review each item critically against the specified inputs and the current system state. Mark each item as Pass (✅) or Fail (❌). Add comments for any Failures. Note that for MAT results (V3.10-V3.13), "Pass" means the *testing was done and documented*, not necessarily that every test case was successful in BB Ultra - the documented failures are critical input for Stage 4.

| **V3.1** | **Integration (3.1)**    | **Component Connection:** Have placeholder functions in FastAPI endpoints (or orchestration logic) been replaced with actual calls to rendering, validation (2.4.1), and packaging (2.5.1) functions? | Code review confirms core logic sequence (render->validate->manifest->validate->package) is implemented, calling the actual Stage 2 functions. Placeholders are removed for the core flow.                                                     |       ☐       |                               |
| **V3.2** | **Integration (3.1)**    | **Basic Execution:** Does the integrated application run locally without immediate crashes related to component wiring (basic smoke test passed)?                | Application starts, and a simple test request through the main endpoint completes (either success or expected handled error), indicating basic wiring is correct.                                                                            |       ☐       |                               |
| **V3.3** | **Unit Tests (3.2)**     | **Existence & Execution:** Does a unit test suite exist? Did `pytest` execution for unit tests complete successfully (all tests passed)?                         | Test files exist in `tests/unit/`. The `pytest` report shows 0 failures/errors for the unit test suite run against the current codebase.                                                                                                   |       ☐       |                               |
| **V3.4** | **Unit Tests (3.2)**     | **Scope Coverage:** Do unit tests cover the core logic implemented in Stage 2 (validation, packaging, key utilities, Pydantic validators)?                         | Review of test files confirms major functions/modules from Stage 2 have corresponding unit tests. (Coverage report ideally shows reasonable % coverage for core logic).                                                                   |       ☐       |                               |
| **V3.5** | **Integration Tests (3.3)** | **Existence & Execution:** Does an integration test suite exist? Did `pytest` execution for integration tests complete successfully (all tests passed)?        | Test files exist in `tests/integration/`. The `pytest` report shows 0 failures/errors for the integration test suite run against the current codebase.                                                                                       |       ☐       |                               |
| **V3.6** | **Integration Tests (3.3)** | **Flow Coverage:** Do integration tests cover the main API endpoint(s) for both successful generation scenarios and expected error handling (e.g., 4xx/5xx)?   | Tests exist simulating valid requests (checking for 200 OK and expected response) and invalid requests (checking for appropriate error status codes like 422 or 500).                                                                        |       ☐       |                               |
| **V3.7** | **Integration Tests (3.3)** | **Output Checks (Sample):** Do successful integration tests perform basic checks on the generated output where feasible (e.g., response structure, ZIP file existence/contents)? | Assertions in relevant tests confirm expected success response format or perform basic checks on generated files (e.g., `imsmanifest.xml` presence in ZIP).                                                                                     |       ☐       |                               |
| **V3.8** | **MAT Process (3.4)**    | **Execution:** Was Manual Acceptance Testing performed against the designated Blackboard Ultra instance for the features implemented?                           | Self-attestation confirms MAT was conducted according to the plan/checklist.                                                                                                                                                               |       ☐       |                               |
| **V3.9** | **MAT Process (3.4)**    | **Scope Coverage:** Did MAT cover the range of implemented features (interaction types, MathML, assets, metadata) using diverse sample data?                   | The MAT Results Log shows test cases covering the implemented feature set.                                                                                                                                                                 |       ☐       |                               |
| **V3.10**| **MAT Results (3.4)**    | **Documentation:** Is there a dedicated MAT Results Log/Document? Is it detailed, recording inputs, steps, expected vs. actual results (incl. screenshots)?    | The log exists and contains sufficient detail to understand what was tested, how, and what the outcome was for each case.                                                                                                               |       ☐       |                               |
| **V3.11**| **MAT Results (3.4)**    | **BB Ultra Import:** Does the log clearly state the success/failure status of importing generated packages into Blackboard Ultra for each relevant test case?    | Each test case involving package generation has a recorded import outcome (Success / Failure + Error Message).                                                                                                                             |       ☐       |                               |
| **V3.12**| **MAT Results (3.4)**    | **BB Ultra Functionality:** Does the log document observations on rendering (text, MathML, assets) and functionality (interaction, scoring, feedback) within BB Ultra? | Observations on how items looked and behaved within BB Ultra are recorded (Pass/Fail + Notes/Screenshots).                                                                                                                                   |       ☐       |                               |
| **V3.13**| **MAT Results (3.4)**    | **Failure Analysis:** For failed MAT cases, is there an initial analysis or clear description enabling bug reporting / refinement task creation for Stage 4?    | Failures are described clearly enough to be actionable (i.e., can be turned into a specific bug report or refinement task).                                                                                                                |       ☐       |                               |
| **V3.14**| **Consistency (Cumulative)**| **Stage 1/2 Alignment:** Does the integrated system behavior (as observed in automated tests and MAT) generally align with the original specs, or are deviations (esp. due to BB Ultra) noted in MAT results? | The system functions broadly as specified. Any necessary deviations found during MAT are documented in the MAT log as issues to be addressed/confirmed in Stage 4.                                                                       |       ☐       |                               |
| **V3.15**| **Overall State**        | **Stability:** Is the codebase considered stable enough (passes automated tests, known issues documented) to serve as a baseline for Stage 4 refinement?        | Automated tests pass. Known issues requiring fixes/refinements are documented (in MAT log or bug tracker), but the core system is functional.                                                                                           |       ☐       |                               |
| **V3.16**| **Overall Process**      | **Version Control:** Is all Stage 3 work (integration code, tests) committed to Git? Are MAT results stored accessibly?                                        | `git status` is clean; `git log` shows commits for Stage 3 work. MAT log is saved and accessible.                                                                                                                                            |       ☐       |                               |

**Remediation Process:**

* If any checklist item is marked Fail (❌):
  * **STOP:** Do not proceed to Stage 4.
  * **Analyze:** Review the comments to understand the failure (e.g., integration tests failing V3.5, MAT not performed V3.8, MAT results poorly documented V3.10, core logic failure contradicts specs V3.14).
  * **Correct:** Go back to the relevant task(s) in Stage 3 (or earlier stages if the root cause is deeper).
    * Fix failing automated tests (unit or integration).
    * Perform or complete missing MAT steps.
    * Improve documentation of MAT results.
    * Correct integration logic.
    * Address any identified deviations from Stages 1/2 specs that weren't intentional adjustments based on MAT findings.
  * **Re-Verify:** Once corrections are made, re-execute this entire Verification Checklist from the beginning. Repeat until all items pass.

**Certification:**

* Once all checklist items are marked Pass (✅):
  * **Sign-off:** Formally record the successful completion of the Stage 3 Verification. Options:
    * Tag the commit in Git (e.g., `git tag stage-3-complete`).
    * Update status in project tracking tool.
    * Add dated entry to project README or log: `Stage 3 Verification completed and passed by [Your Name] on [Date]. Integration successful, automated tests pass, MAT performed & documented. Proceeding to Stage 4.`
  * **Proceed:** You are now certified to begin Stage 4: Iteration & Refinement, using the documented MAT results and any other identified issues as primary input.

This Stage 3 verification gate ensures that the integration was successful, the system is demonstrably testable, and, most importantly, that the crucial feedback from real-world testing (Blackboard Ultra MAT) is captured and ready to inform the refinement process before significant further development or refactoring occurs.
